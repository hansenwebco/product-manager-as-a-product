                    <p>After nine years with Accusoft and Docubee, both companies have been acquired and it's time to look forward to the next step in my career. I'm beyond appreciative of the many people I was able to work with and learn from over the last near decade. Accusoft and Docubee were filled with talented, smart, and kind people pushing to make the best products possible. A special thanks to Jack Berlin and his leadership team who fostered innovation and cultivated talent here in Tampa.</p>

                    <p>With that said, I've done a great deal of thinking about how to embark on the job search and find my place in a new organization. Considering the tough job market, what better way to tackle that problem than to apply the years of experience taking new products to market and shift it to something more personal, myself.</p>

                    <p>With so many tools at my disposal, it felt like a natural fit to take these lessons and apply them to my job search. What is my product market fit? What KPIs and metrics can I use to track progress? What is my target persona? Do I need a backlog for this? (I do love a nice backlog.)</p>

                    <p>For now, I've started with the basics, applying for roles that are interesting and where I feel I would bring value. Right now I've been tracking basic metrics, submittals, rejections, interviews, dates, etc. The last few weeks have been dealing with a transition to the new organization and the chaos that goes with that. This week I plan to reflect on what is working well and what isn't and from there start applying what I can from the PM world to the job hunt.</p>

                    <p>If you're out there looking or just want to follow along, feel free to add me on LinkedIn if you haven't already, and if you have ideas I would love to hear them as well!</p>
