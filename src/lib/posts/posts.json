            "cardContent": "<p>After nine years with Accusoft and Docubee, both companies have been acquired and it's time to look forward to the next step in my career. I'm beyond appreciative of the many people I was able to work with and learn from over the last near decade. Accusoft and Docubee were filled with talented, smart, and kind people pushing to make the best products possible. A special thanks to Jack Berlin and his leadership team who fostered innovation and cultivated talent here in Tampa.</p><p>With that said, I've done a great deal of thinking about how to embark on the job search and find my place in a new organization. Considering the tough job market, what better way to tackle that problem than to apply the years of experience taking new products to market and shift it to something more personal, myself.</p><p>With so many tools at my disposal, it felt like a natural fit to take these lessons and apply them to my job search. What is my product market fit? What KPIs and metrics can I use to track progress? What is my target persona? Do I need a backlog for this? (I do love a nice backlog.)</p><p>For now, I've started with the basics, applying for roles that are interesting and where I feel I would bring value. Right now I've been tracking basic metrics, submittals, rejections, interviews, dates, etc. The last few weeks have been dealing with a transition to the new organization and the chaos that goes with that. This week I plan to reflect on what is working well and what isn't and from there start applying what I can from the PM world to the job hunt.</p><p>If you're out there looking or just want to follow along, feel free to add me on LinkedIn if you haven't already, and if you have ideas I would love to hear them as well!</p>"

            "cardContent": "<p>As I've started looking for a new role, I naturally felt the need to figure out how things are progressing. In the product management world, we often look to KPIs, or key performance indicators. The basic idea is to track a few things that show whether we're being successful and making progress toward a goal.</p><p>I've started breaking what I'm tracking into two buckets: metrics and KPIs. So far, it's looking something like this:</p><p><strong>KPIs:</strong><ul><li>Application Rejections</li><li>Application Interviews</li><li>Social Discussions (conversations about possible roles outside of the interview process / networking)</li></ul></p><p><strong>Metrics:</strong><ul><li>Applications Submitted</li><li>Social Events Attended</li><li>Social Outreach (reaching out to my network and friends)</li></ul></p><p>So far, rejections are the only thing driving any data. That's thanks to slow response times and, for lack of a better term, the black hole of nonresponses that applications tend to disappear into. I've been reading Project Hail Mary lately, and space feels like a fitting theme. My current rejection rate is around 20 percent, meaning 80 percent of applications have just vanished without a trace.</p><p>Still, I've got a place to start, and that's something. It got me thinking, where can I experiment from here?</p><p>Lately I've been wondering about ATS systems and how every application must look the same on the other end. An application field like the job title &quot;Product Manager&quot; shows up identically across applicants' resumes. But what if I tried something different, like &quot;PRODUCT MANAGER&quot; all caps or even &quot;*** PRODUCT MANAGER ***&quot;? Would it stand out? And more importantly, would that attention help or hurt?</p><p>I've also been thinking a lot about the types of companies I'm applying to, the size, revenue, age, and so on. In my backlog (yeah I created one) is building out a target profile of what the ideal company looks like. Hopefully, once I decide what a good fit looks like, I can tailor experiments like this toward the places I'd actually be excited to join.</p><p>So that's my homework for the week: define my ideal employer persona and start experimenting with how I apply to see if I can move the needle a bit.</p><p>In the meantime, if you're looking for a Product Manager, you don't need to wait for the end of this experiment. I'd love to chat now. Links and contact info are at the top!</p>"
